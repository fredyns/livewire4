# Collapse Plugin

**Source URL:** https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/collapse

## Overview

Alpine's Collapse plugin allows you to expand and collapse elements using smooth animations.

Because this behavior and implementation differs from Alpine's standard transition system, this functionality was made into a dedicated plugin.

## Installation

You can use this plugin by either including it from a `<script>` tag or installing it via NPM:

### Via CDN

You can include the CDN build of this plugin as a `<script>` tag, just make sure to include it BEFORE Alpine's core JS file.

```html
<!-- Alpine Plugins -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alpinejs/collapse@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
 
<!-- Alpine Core -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

### Via NPM

You can install Collapse from NPM for use inside your bundle like so:

```bash
npm install @alpinejs/collapse
```

Then initialize it from your bundle:

```javascript
import Alpine from 'alpinejs'
import collapse from '@alpinejs/collapse'
 
Alpine.plugin(collapse)
```

## x-collapse

The primary API for using this plugin is the `x-collapse` directive.

`x-collapse` can only exist on an element that already has an `x-show` directive. When added to an `x-show` element, `x-collapse` will smoothly "collapse" and "expand" the element when it's visibility is toggled by animating its height property.

For example:

```html
<div x-data="{ expanded: false }">
    <button @click="expanded = ! expanded">Toggle Content</button>
 
    <p x-show="expanded" x-collapse>
        ...
    </p>
</div>
```

---

## Modifiers

### .duration

You can customize the duration of the collapse/expand transition by appending the `.duration` modifier like so:

```html
<div x-data="{ expanded: false }">
    <button @click="expanded = ! expanded">Toggle Content</button>
 
    <p x-show="expanded" x-collapse.duration.1000ms>
        ...
    </p>
</div>
```

### .min

By default, `x-collapse`'s "collapsed" state sets the height of the element to 0px and also sets `display: none;`.

Sometimes, it's helpful to "cut-off" an element rather than fully hide it. By using the `.min` modifier, you can set a minimum height for `x-collapse`'s "collapsed" state. For example:

```html
<div x-data="{ expanded: false }">
    <button @click="expanded = ! expanded">Toggle Content</button>
 
    <p x-show="expanded" x-collapse.min.50px>
        ...
    </p>
</div>
```
