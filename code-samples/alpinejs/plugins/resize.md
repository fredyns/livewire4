# Resize Plugin

**Source URL:** https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/resize

## Overview

Alpine's Resize plugin is a convenience wrapper for the Resize Observer that allows you to easily react when an element changes size.

This is useful for: custom size-based animations, intelligent sticky positioning, conditionally adding attributes based on the element's size, etc.

## Installation

You can use this plugin by either including it from a `<script>` tag or installing it via NPM:

### Via CDN

You can include the CDN build of this plugin as a `<script>` tag, just make sure to include it BEFORE Alpine's core JS file.

```html
<!-- Alpine Plugins -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alpinejs/resize@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
 
<!-- Alpine Core -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

### Via NPM

You can install Resize from NPM for use inside your bundle like so:

```bash
npm install @alpinejs/resize
```

Then initialize it from your bundle:

```javascript
import Alpine from 'alpinejs'
import resize from '@alpinejs/resize'
 
Alpine.plugin(resize)
```

## x-resize

The primary API for using this plugin is `x-resize`. You can add `x-resize` to any element within an Alpine component, and when that element is resized for any reason, the provided expression will execute with two magic properties: `$width` and `$height`.

For example, here's a simple example of using `x-resize` to display the width and height of an element as it changes size.

```html
<div
    x-data="{ width: 0, height: 0 }"
    x-resize="width = $width; height = $height"
>
    <p x-text="'Width: ' + width + 'px'"></p>
    <p x-text="'Height: ' + height + 'px'"></p>
</div>
```

Resize your browser window to see the width and height values change.

## Modifiers

### .document

It's often useful to observe the entire document's size, rather than a specific element. To do this, you can add the `.document` modifier to `x-resize`:

```html
<div x-resize.document="...">
```
