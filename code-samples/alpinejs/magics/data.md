# $data

## Overview

`$data` is a magic property that gives you access to the current Alpine data scope (generally provided by `x-data`).

Most of the time, you can just access Alpine data within expressions directly. For example `x-data="{ message: 'Hello Caleb!' }"` will allow you to do things like `x-text="message"`.

However, sometimes it is helpful to have an actual object that encapsulates all scope that you can pass around to other functions:

```html
<div x-data="{ greeting: 'Hello' }">
    <div x-data="{ name: 'Caleb' }">
        <button @click="sayHello($data)">Say Hello</button>
    </div>
</div>
 
<script>
    function sayHello({ greeting, name }) {
        alert(greeting + ' ' + name + '!')
    }
</script>
```

Now when the button is pressed, the browser will alert "Hello Caleb!" because it was passed a data object that contained all the Alpine scope of the expression that called it (`@click="..."`).

Most applications won't need this magic property, but it can be very helpful for deeper, more complicated Alpine utilities.
