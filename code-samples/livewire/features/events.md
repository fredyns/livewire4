# Events

source: https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/4.x/eventsLivewire offers a robust event system that you can use to communicate between different components on the page. Because it uses browser events under the hood, you can also use Livewire's event system to communicate with Alpine components or even plain, vanilla JavaScript.To trigger an event, you may use the `dispatch()` method from anywhere inside your component and listen for that event from any other component on the page.

#

# Dispatching eventsTo dispatch an event from a Livewire component, call the `dispatch()` method, passing it the event name and any additional data you want to send along with the event.Example dispatching a `post-created` event from a `post.create` component:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public function save()    {        // ...        $this->dispatch('post-created');    }};

```

In this example, when the `dispatch()` method is called, the `post-created` event will be dispatched, and every other component on the page that is listening for this event will be notified.You can pass additional data with the event by passing the data as additional named parameters:

```

php$this->dispatch('post-created', title: $post->title);

```

#

# Listening for eventsTo listen for an event in a Livewire component, add the `#[On]` attribute above the method you want to be called when a given event is dispatched.Make sure you import any attribute classes. For example, `#[On()]` requires `use Livewire\Attributes\On;`.

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\On;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    #[On('post-created')]    public function updatePostList($title)    {        // ...    }};

```

Now, when the `post-created` event is dispatched from `post.create`, a network request will be triggered and the `updatePostList()` action will be invoked.As you can see, additional data sent with the event will be provided to the action as its first argument.

#

#

# Listening for dynamic event namesOccasionally, you may want to dynamically generate event listener names at run-time using data from your component.For example, if you wanted to scope an event listener to a specific Eloquent model, you could append the model's ID to the event name when dispatching:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public function update()    {        // ...        $this->dispatch("post-updated.{$post->id}");    }};

```

And then listen for that specific model:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.phpuse App\Models\Post;use Livewire\Attributes\On;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public Post $post;    #[On('post-updated.{post.id}')]    public function refreshPost()    {        // ...    }};

```

If the `$post` model had an ID of `3`, the `refreshPost()` method would only be triggered by an event named: `post-updated.3`.

#

#

# Listening for events from specific child componentsLivewire allows you to listen for events directly on individual child components in your Blade template:

```

blade<div>    <livewire:edit-post @saved="$refresh">        <!-- ... -->    </livewire:edit-post></div>

```

In the above scenario, if the `edit-post` child component dispatches a `saved` event, the parent's `$refresh` will be called and the parent will be refreshed.Instead of passing `$refresh`, you can pass any method you normally would to something like `wire:click`:

```

blade<livewire:edit-post @saved="close">

```

If the child dispatched parameters along with the request (for example: `$this->dispatch('saved', postId: 1)`), you can forward those values to the parent method using the following syntax:

```

blade<livewire:edit-post @saved="close($event.detail.postId)">

```

#

# Using JavaScript to interact with eventsLivewire's event system becomes much more powerful when you interact with it from JavaScript inside your application. This unlocks the ability for any other JavaScript in your app to communicate with Livewire components on the page.

#

#

# Listening for events inside component scriptsYou can listen for the `post-created` event inside your component's template from a `<script>` tag:

```

html<script>    this.$on('post-created', () => {        // ...    })</script>

```

The above snippet listens for the `post-created` event from the component it's registered within. If the component is no longer on the page, the event listener will no longer be triggered.Read more about using JavaScript inside your Livewire components.

#

#

# Dispatching events from component scriptsYou can dispatch events from within a component's `<script>` tag:

```

html<script>    this.$dispatch('post-created')</script>

```

When the above script is run, the `post-created` event will be dispatched to the component it's defined within.To dispatch the event only to the component where the script resides and not other components on the page (preventing the event from "bubbling" up), you can use `dispatchSelf()`:

```

jsthis.$dispatchSelf('post-created');

```

You can pass additional parameters to the event by passing an object as a second argument to `dispatch()`:

```

html<script>    this.$dispatch('post-created', { refreshPosts: true })</script>

```

You can now access those event parameters from both your Livewire class and also other JavaScript event listeners.Receiving the `refreshPosts` parameter within a Livewire class:

```

phpuse Livewire\Attributes\On;// ...#[On('post-created')]public function handleNewPost($refreshPosts = false){    // ...}

```

Accessing the `refreshPosts` parameter from a JavaScript event listener using `event.detail`:

```

html<script>    this.$on('post-created', (event) => {        let refreshPosts = event.detail.refreshPosts        // ...    })</script>

```

Read more about using JavaScript inside your Livewire components.

#

#

# Listening for Livewire events from global JavaScriptAlternatively, you can listen for Livewire events globally using `Livewire.on` from any script in your application:

```

html<script>    document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {        Livewire.on('post-created', (event) => {            // ...        })    })</script>

```

The above snippet listens for the `post-created` event dispatched from any component on the page.If you wish to remove this event listener for any reason, you can do so using the returned cleanup function:

```

html<script>    document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {        let cleanup = Livewire.on('post-created', (event) => {            // ...        })        // Calling "cleanup()" will un-register the above event listener...        cleanup()    })</script>

```

#

# Events in AlpineBecause Livewire events are plain browser events under the hood, you can use Alpine to listen for them or even dispatch them.

#

#

# Listening for Livewire events in AlpineListen for the `post-created` event using Alpine:

```

html<div x-on:post-created="..."></div>

```

The above snippet would listen for the `post-created` event from any Livewire components that are children of the HTML element that the `x-on` directive is assigned to.To listen for the event from any Livewire component on the page, add `.window` to the listener:

```

html<div x-on:post-created.window="..."></div>

```

If you want to access additional data that was sent with the event, you can do so using `$event.detail`:

```

html<div x-on:post-created="notify('New post: ' + $event.detail.title)"></div>

```

#

#

# Dispatching Livewire events from AlpineAny event dispatched from Alpine is capable of being intercepted by a Livewire component.Dispatch the `post-created` event from Alpine:

```

html<button x-on:click="$dispatch('post-created')">...</button>

```

Like Livewire's `dispatch()` method, you can pass additional data along with the event by passing the data as the second parameter:

```

html<button x-on:click="$dispatch('post-created', { title: 'Post Title' })">...</button>

```

If you are using events to call behavior on a parent from a child, you can instead call the action directly from the child using `$parent` in your Blade template:

```

blade<button wire:click="$parent.showCreatePostForm()">Create Post</button>

```

Learn more about `$parent`.

#

# Dispatching directly to another componentIf you want to use events for communicating directly between two components on the page, you can use the `dispatch()->to()` modifier.Example of `post.create` dispatching the `post-created` event directly to the `dashboard` component:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public function save()    {        // ...        $this->dispatch('post-created')->to(component: Dashboard::class);    }};

```

#

# Dispatching a component event to itselfUsing the `dispatch()->self()` modifier, you can restrict an event to only being intercepted by the component it was triggered from:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public function save()    {        // ...        $this->dispatch('post-created')->to(self: true);    }};

```

#

# Dispatching events from Blade templatesYou can dispatch events directly from your Blade templates using the `$dispatch` JavaScript function.Example triggering an event from a user interaction:

```

blade<button wire:click="$dispatch('show-post-modal', { id: {{ $post->id }} })">EditPost</button>

```

If you want to dispatch an event directly to another component you can use the `$dispatchTo()` JavaScript function:

```

blade<button wire:click="$dispatchTo('posts', 'show-post-modal', { id: {{ $post->id }} })">EditPost</button>

```

#

# Testing dispatched eventsTo test events dispatched by your component, use the `assertDispatched()` method in your Livewire test.

```

php<?phpnamespace Tests\Feature;use App\Livewire\CreatePost;use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;use Livewire\Livewire;class CreatePostTest extends TestCase{    use RefreshDatabase;    public function test_it_dispatches_post_created_event()    {        Livewire::test(CreatePost::class)            ->call('save')            ->assertDispatched('post-created');    }}

```

#

#

# Testing Event ListenersTo test event listeners, you can dispatch events from the test environment and assert that the expected actions are performed in response to the event:

```

php<?phpnamespace Tests\Feature;use App\Livewire\Dashboard;use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;use Livewire\Livewire;class DashboardTest extends TestCase{    use RefreshDatabase;    public function test_it_updates_post_count_when_a_post_is_created()    {        Livewire::test(Dashboard::class)            ->assertSee('Posts created: 0')            ->dispatch('post-created')            ->assertSee('Posts created: 1');    }}

```

#

# Real-time events using Laravel EchoLivewire pairs nicely with Laravel Echo to provide real-time functionality on your web-pages using WebSockets.This feature assumes you have installed Laravel Echo and the `window.Echo` object is globally available in your application.For more information on installing Echo, check out the Laravel Echo documentation.

#

#

# Listening for Echo eventsImagine you have an event in your Laravel application named `OrderShipped`:

```

php<?phpnamespace App\Events;use App\Models\Order;use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets;use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;class OrderShipped implements ShouldBroadcast{    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;    public Order $order;    public function broadcastOn()    {        return new Channel('orders');    }}

```

You might dispatch this event from another part of your application:

```

phpuse App\Events\OrderShipped;OrderShipped::dispatch();

```

If you were to listen for this event in JavaScript using only Laravel Echo:

```

jsEcho.channel('orders')    .listen('OrderShipped', e => {        console.log(e.order)    })

```

Assuming you have Laravel Echo installed and configured, you can listen for this event from inside a Livewire component.Example `order-tracker` component listening for the `OrderShipped` event to show users a visual indication of a new order:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/⚡order-tracker.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\On;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public $showNewOrderNotification = false;    #[On('echo:orders,OrderShipped')]    public function notifyNewOrder()    {        $this->showNewOrderNotification = true;    }    // ...};

```

If you have Echo channels with variables embedded in them (such as an Order ID), you can define listeners via the `getListeners()` method instead of the `#[On]` attribute:

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/⚡order-tracker.blade.phpuse App\Models\Order;use Livewire\Attributes\On;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public Order $order;    public $showOrderShippedNotification = false;    public function getListeners()    {        return [            "echo:orders.{$this->order->id},OrderShipped" => 'notifyShipped',        ];    }    public function notifyShipped()    {        $this->showOrderShippedNotification = true;    }    // ...};

```

Or, you can use the dynamic event name syntax:

```

php#[On('echo:orders.{order.id},OrderShipped')]public function notifyNewOrder(){    $this->showNewOrderNotification = true;}

```

If you need to access the event payload, you can do so via the passed-in `$event` parameter:

```

php#[On('echo:orders.{order.id},OrderShipped')]public function notifyNewOrder($event){    $order = Order::find($event['orderId']);    // ...}

```

#

#

# Customizing broadcast event names with broadcastAs()By default, Laravel broadcasts events using the event class name.However, you can customize the broadcast event name by implementing the `broadcastAs()` method in your event class.Example broadcasting `ScoreSubmitted` as `score.submitted`:

```

php<?phpnamespace App\Events;use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets;use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;class ScoreSubmitted implements ShouldBroadcast{    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;    public function broadcastOn()    {        return new Channel('scores');    }    public function broadcastAs(): string    {        return 'score.submitted';    }}

```

When listening for this event in a Livewire component, you should use the custom broadcast name returned by `broadcastAs()` instead of the class name.Important: When using a custom broadcast name, you must prefix it with a dot (`.`) to distinguish it from namespaced event class names. This is a Laravel Echo convention.

```

php<?phpnamespace App\Livewire;use Livewire\Attributes\On;use Livewire\Component;class ScoreBoard extends Component{    public $scores = [];    #[On('echo:scores,.score.submitted')]    public function handleScoreSubmitted($event)    {        $this->scores[] = $event['score'];    }}

```

You can also use the custom broadcast name with dynamic channel names:

```

php#[On('echo:scores.{game.id},.score.submitted')]public function handleScoreSubmitted($event){    $this->scores[] = $event['score'];}

```

#

#

# Private & presence channelsYou may also listen to events broadcast to private and presence channels.Before proceeding, ensure you have defined Authentication Callbacks for your broadcast channels.

```

php<?php// resources/views/components/⚡order-tracker.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component{    public $showNewOrderNotification = false;    public function getListeners()    {        return [            // Public Channel            "echo:orders,OrderShipped" => 'notifyNewOrder',            // Private Channel            "echo-private:orders,OrderShipped" => 'notifyNewOrder',            // Presence Channel            "echo-presence:orders,OrderShipped" => 'notifyNewOrder',            "echo-presence:orders,here" => 'notifyNewOrder',            "echo-presence:orders,joining" => 'notifyNewOrder',            "echo-presence:orders,leaving" => 'notifyNewOrder',        ];    }    public function notifyNewOrder()    {        $this->showNewOrderNotification = true;    }};

```
