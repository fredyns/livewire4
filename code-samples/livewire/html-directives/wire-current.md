# wire:currentsource: https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/4.x/wire-current

The `wire:current` directive allows you to easily detect and style currently active links on a page.Livewire automatically adds a `data-current` attribute to all `wire:navigate` links that match the current page. You can style these links directly with Tailwind's `data-current:` variant or CSS, without needing the `wire:current` directive.Learn more about automatic `data-current`.

#

# Basic usage

Simple example adding `wire:current` to links in a navbar so that the currently active link has a stronger font weight:



```blade
<nav>    <a href="/dashboard" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Dashboard</a>    <a href="/posts" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Posts</a>    <a href="/users" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Users</a></nav>

```



Now when a user visits `/posts`, the "Posts" link will have a stronger font treatment than the other links.You should note that `wire:current` works out of the box with `wire:navigate` links and page changes, and automatically adds the `data-current` attribute to matching links in addition to the specified classes.

#

# Exact matching

By default, `wire:current` uses a partial matching strategy.This means it will be applied if the link and current page share the beginning portion of the URL's path.For example, if the link is `/posts`, and the current page is `/posts/1`, the `wire:current` directive will be applied.If you wish to use exact matching, you can add the `.exact` modifier.Example preventing the "Dashboard" link from being highlighted when the user visits `/posts`:



```blade
<nav>    <a href="/" wire:current.exact="font-bold">Dashboard</a></nav>

```



#

# Strict matching

By default, `wire:current` will remove trailing slashes (`/`) from its comparison.If you'd like to disable this behavior and force a strict path string comparison, you can append the `.strict` modifier:



```blade
<nav>    <a href="/posts/" wire:current.strict="font-bold">Dashboard</a></nav>

```



#

# Troubleshooting

If `wire:current` is not detecting the current link correctly, ensure the following:
- You have at least one Livewire component on the page, or have hardcoded `@livewireScripts` in your layout- You have a `href` attribute on the link

#

# Reference



```text
wire:current="classes"

```



#

#

# Modifiers
- `.exact`- `.strict`
