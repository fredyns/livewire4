Livewire

'

s ability to make updates to the page is what makes it "live". However, there are times when you might want to prevent Livewire from updating a portion of the page.In these cases, you can use the `wire:ignore` directive to instruct Livewire to ignore the contents of a particular element, even if they change between requests.This is most useful in the context of working with third-party JavaScript libraries for custom form inputs and such.

#

# Basic usage

Example wrapping an element used by a third-party library in `wire:ignore` so that Livewire doesn't tamper with the HTML generated by the library:



```blade
<form>    <!-- ... -->    <div wire:ignore>        <!-- This element would be reference by a -->        <!-- third-party library for initialization... -->        <input id="id-for-date-picker-library">    </div>    <!-- ... --></form>

```



#

# Ignoring updates to self

You can also instruct Livewire to only ignore changes to attributes of the root element rather than observing changes to its contents using `wire:ignore.self`.



```blade
<div wire:ignore.self>    <!-- ... --></div>

```



#

# Reference



```text
wire:ignore

```





```text
wire:ignore.self

```

# Modifiers
- `.self`
